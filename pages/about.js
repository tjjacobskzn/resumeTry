        managements, machining and managing the workshop since I can remember

        I worked in our family-owned boat storage facility since it opened in
        2017. There I did maintenance on overall exterior and interior spots,
        overhauled and serviced engines, learnt to work on fibreglass, worked as
        a deckhand for clients and experienced tactical forklift driving daily

        knowledge on petrol and diesel engines, both four and two-stroke.
